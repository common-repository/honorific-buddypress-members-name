== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is  this plugin for? =

This plugin is for adding honorifics to member's names.

=  What is "honorific" and why we need it? =

An "honorific" is a title that conveys esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. 
We need an honorific to show our respect and its the formal way of greeting a person.

For example, let's say you are in  a corporate meeting and there is a person named Alex, but if you address him as Alex its very informal and not acceptable. So you need to address him as Mr. Alex. This is why you need to use honorific in user's name. 

= Is this plugin independent? =

No, this plugin requires buddypress plugin, as it is developed for adding honorifics in buddypress member's name.
